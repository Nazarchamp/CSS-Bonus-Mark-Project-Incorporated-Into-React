CSS bonus marks incorporated into the react project I made

The usage of advanced CSS is located in terms of Flexbox applied throughout the entire project, where almost every div uses flexbox.
In terms of CSS grid it is located within the way that the code is now displayed as a css grid and moves to a new row when the page gets smaller
And in terms of SCSS is applied onto the main stylesheet
